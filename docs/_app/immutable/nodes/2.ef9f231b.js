Culture-médias et Cinéma à l'âge Hypermoderne," by French sociologist Gilles Lipovetsky, the lengthening of movies is a way for producers to reduce uncertainty amid fierce competition in the film market. Looking at it this way, to dispel the gloom of the pandemic, both producers and theaters are more inclined to release longer, more stimulating films to restore cash flow and reduce risks.`}},cl={static1:{p1:"Lipovetsky summarized that extended film runtimes are one characteristic of contemporary cinema. Additionally, the pursuit of pace, sex, violence, speed, cinematography, and editing are evident features, which he refers to as the exaggeration of movies.",p2:"Also, this tendency toward exaggeration might result from films adapting to audience preferences. Hollywood films known for big stars, grand scenes, strong special effects, and fast pace contribute 85% of the global box office. Their dominance stems from targeting young people, the world's largest consumer group.",p3:`Lipovetsky commented: "In the past, moviegoers wanted to dream; now, the super-consumers of the new world want to feel something, to be shocked, to 'immerse themselves,' experiencing continuous and endless emotional impacts."`},scrolly1:{p1:"The three years of the pandemic have heightened audiences' demand for emotional impact; movies have become a means for people to release pent-up frustration and anxiety.

According to Gilles Lipovetsky’s book, In the 1940s, even top film companies' advertising expenses didn't exceed 7% of the production budget. Nowadays, the average promotional budget for American films exceeds one-third of the production budget, and in some cases, it surpasses half.",p4:`Moreover, a hefty budget can attract more appealing casts and renowned directors (like Marvel's star-studded productions). The top ten directors who have made the most long movies are big names familiar to the general public. Leading the list is Ridley Scott, director of "Gladiator," with 15 long movies; followed by Clint Eastwood, director of "Mystic River," with 12; Martin Scorsese ("Taxi Driver"), Ron Howard ("A Beautiful Mind"), and Michael Bay ("Transformers") tie for third with ten films each.`,p5:`Additionally, among these ten directors, the proportion of long movies to their total films is at least three-quarters. For Martin Scorsese and Michael Bay, 100% of their movies are long films.  <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/features/batman-spider-man-long-movie-runtimes-1235187797/">According to "Variety,"</a> , in the U.S., studio contracts with directors usually stipulate that a movie's runtime cannot exceed two hours, but some directors simply ignore this clause, and studios don't enforce it.

However, long films demand more of the audience's time, naturally raising their expectations. To meet these expectations, producers have to invest even more, creating a cycle.",p2:`More notably, these resources are often concentrated on a few films, like "Titanic" ,"Avatar" and all those superheroe blockbusters.Consumers' choices are subtly guided and limited because if we don't opt for those heavily promoted films, how many options do we really have left?`,p3:"Every movie is a brand-new journey. However, as film choices become increasingly uniform, coupled with the exaggerated use of sex, violence, speed, and extended runtimes, it may lead to sensory overload and changes in how we experience them physically. Lipovetsky believes that the movie screen is the most original screen, and all other screens derive from it, integrating into our lives and being ubiquitous. People immerse themselves in screens, and life seems to become one movie after another.",p4:`Just like short videos—they're like "extreme" movies, playing constantly on the screens closest to us, filling each day with intense emotions and visual impacts. Pain, joy, excitement, and sadness split every minute apart. Yet, when we uncontrollably finish watching short videos, we often feel utterly exhausted.
